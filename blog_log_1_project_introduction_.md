# Project Introduction

Welcome to the first dev log for my game _Starfleet Command_, a 2D top-down space strategy game I'm developing with the 
SFML library and C++. In this post, I will introduce the core concept and vision behind the game along with outlining some
of the planned gameplay mechanics. Let's begin.

## Preliminary Concept
_Starfleet Command_ pits the player against an AI opponent in an intense battle for supremacy. The goal is simple: defend
your capital ship at all costs while battling to destroy the enemy's. Battles unfold across five "space lanes", where
players must strategically deploy starships, manage resources, and make tactical decisions in real-time to outmaneuver
their adaptive AI opponent.

## Inspiration
Initially, I set out to create a game similar to Age of War but with a focus on improving replayability. To achieve this,
I wanted to implement two key systems, a roguelike/roguelite reward system and an AI Director. This would keep the 
experience fresh and dynamic so that no two playthroughs are the same. 

As the concept developed, I also began to draw inspiration from Plants vs. Zombies, particularly it's lane-based strategy
mechanics and last line of defence mechanic. 




The inspiration for _Starfleet Command_ came from my love of two classic strategy defense games: Age of War and Plants
Vs Zombies. Combining elements from both, _Starfleet Command_ aims to capture the best of these games while introducing
other interesting mechanics to bring more replayability.

## Next Steps
Text

## Unsorted Notes

- Taking inspiration from Age of War and Plants vs Zombies

- I wanted to create a game that blends together mechanics from these games (tower defence gameplay, resource management, upgrades/progression, lane-based gameplay, unit production/training).

- I also wanted to develop a real-time strategy and a tower defense game

- Provide my own take, blending some mechanics from either game, and throwing in my own mechanics
